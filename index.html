                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">I grew up in Amman, Jordan. After high school, everyone went to university. I didn't.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">I took a gap year. To figure out what I actually wanted. I just knew the traditional path wasn't it.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">I tried dropshipping first. It failed before it started. Stripe doesn't work in Jordan. I was 18 with no bank account, no money, and I didn't even know you could set up a US LLC.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">So I pivoted. Started writing on Twitter. Selling digital products. Notion templates. I processed payments through Gumroad because it was the only thing that worked. One template made me $3.5k in a single day. I did that for a few months.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">Then I started a marketing agency. I was cold calling construction companies in the US from my room. It started as basic marketing. Getting them leads, building their online presence. Then it evolved. Marketing became automation. Automation became AI. I started deploying agents on the backend. Text sequences, email flows, systems to handle the volume of business I was bringing them. I wasn't just generating leads anymore. I was building the infrastructure to convert them.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">Most months I made $8-12k. Sometimes more. I did that for almost two years.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">At 19, I set up a free zone company in Dubai so I could process payments properly. I started moving between Dubai and Amman every few months, running everything remotely.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">Now I'm 21. I run <a href="https://getaurify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aurify</a>. We deploy AI agents that recover abandoned carts for e-commerce brands. Through SMS, with real conversations. Not generic reminders. We figure out why they hesitated and bring them back.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">More than 70% of carts get abandoned. Most brands treat that as a benchmark. We see it as untapped gold.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">I read a lot. The books that shaped me: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Power of Now</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surrender-Experiment-Journey-Lifes-Perfection/dp/080414110X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Surrender Experiment</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supernatural-Common-People-Uncommon/dp/1401953115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becoming Supernatural</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Human-Nature-Robert-Greene/dp/0525428143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Laws of Human Nature</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/50th-Law-50-Cent/dp/006177460X" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 50th Law</a>.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">In my opinion, nothing we do in this life will matter. Nothing. We die. It's all temporary. We think it matters because we're alive. We're dreaming. Once we die, we'll know none of it did. So might as well do exactly what you want.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph fadeInUp">"Build a garden in a dying world."</p>
